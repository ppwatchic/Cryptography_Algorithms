# Cryptography_Algorithms

A series of cryptography algorithms will show here.

1, RSAPerformance_Java_Ubuntu.zip
1.1 running under linux OS with Eclipse installed.
1.2 uses to test performance of RSA1024 using Java's security API. 
1.3 Performance can reach ms_level to encrypt files less than 256Bs.
1.4 tested: Feb 22, 2016

2, RSA1024-master
2.1 running under linux OS, implemented in C.
2.2 RSA1024 in C;
2.3 performance are not good, takes 15secs to encrypt 32Bytes
2.4 tested: Jan 2016
